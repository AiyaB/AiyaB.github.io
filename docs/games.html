          <li><strong>Redemption-</strong> Each member of the losing team shoots one at a time until they miss. If they get all remaining cups then each team starts with 3 cups and plays on (original winners start)</li>
          <li><strong>Lose while opponent still has a full rack-</strong> Pants off around the building or 3 laps around the table</li>
          <li>There are no other rules. Sorry North Americans</li>

        <h2>Travelin</h2>
        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <ul class="gameRules">
          <li>2-5 players, 10 minutes per player</li>
          <li><strong>Country card-</strong> Card with country, has points in a yellow circle in the top-left.</li>
          <li><strong>Action card-</strong> , have a blue arrow in the top left. </li>
          <li><strong>Special card-</strong> , have a red map-marker icon in the top left.</li>
          <li>Each player gets dealt 8 cards face-down, and 3 cards placed face-up in the middle (the common cards). Players without at least 1 country card put their hand in the discard pile and get dealt 8 new cards.</li>
          <li>Each player starts by picking their first travel point by choosing 1 country card from their hand to place face-down in front of them. Once everyone places a card, reveal all the picked cards. The player with the lowest-point country goes first, with ties settled by who was born furthest from here.

              <li><strong>Melbourne</strong> 15319km</li>
              <li><strong>Adelaide</strong> 14669km</li>

          </li>
          <li>At the start of a turn, players can either draw 1 card from the 3 common cards, the top discarded card, or 2 cards from the deck.</li>
          <li>The player may then take 1 action during their turn, either by playing an action card or by using a played country card (used country cards get turned upside down and are then unuseable).</li>
          <li>Action cards such as a bus/train allow players to reach countries. To play a country card, it must be connected to a player's last-played country card</li>
          <li>To end a turn, the player discards 1 card from their hand face-up into the discard pile.</li>
          <li>Players must always have 1 played country card, so certain actions such as Russian Gambit or Arrogant Backpacker cannot be used on players with only 1 country.</li>
          <li>Once a player has 5 played country cards, the game ends. That player gets a 5-point bonus.</li>
          <li>Player with the most points at the end wins. Ties settled by whoever travelled to the most countries during the game.</li>
